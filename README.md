I am a Data Engineer with solid experience in Big Data, SQL, and Python. I specialize in transforming data into strategic insights and automating processes through REST and SOAP APIs, SAP ERP, and RPA technologies.

I design and develop reports and interactive dashboards using Power BI and Excel, and create customized solutions in Python and JavaScript to optimize workflows and minimize errors.

My focus is on ensuring data quality, enhancing operational efficiency, and consistently meeting SLA commitments.
